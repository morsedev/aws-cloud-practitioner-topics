# Topics Required for AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam

This list is a summary of Andrew Brown's excellent video from freeCodeCamp.org available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hLmDS179YE

## General

- Regions
	- e.g. us-east (largest)
- Availability Zones 
	- Full datacenter owned and run by AWS
	- Hosts addplications, databases, websites, file storage etc...
	- Each region has at least 2 AZ
	- AZs are identified with a number at the end, e.g. us-east1
	- Ping below 1ms
- Edge Zones
	- Smaller datacenter owned by trusted partner
	- Has direct connection to AWS network
	- Serve requests for CloudFront (CDN) and Route53 (DNS)
	- Mostly used for caching static content
	- S3 buckets and API gateways also use Edge network
	- Benefit: Low latency as close to user's location

## AWS GovCloud
- Host sensitive, controlled, unclassified Information
- Datacenters only operated by US citizens on US soil
- Only accessible to root account holders (need screening process) and US entities
- Used to comply with certain US regulations, e.g. FedRamp, Department of Defense etc.

## Services overview

	- Apps which are predictable and steady
	- Pricing based on
		- Term
		- Class Offering
		- Payment Option
			- Standard
				- Up 75% cheaper than on-demand
				- Cannot change RI attributes (e.g. instance type)
			- Convertible
				- 54% cheaper than on-demand
				- Allows changing RI attributes if greater or equal in value
			- Scheduled
				- Reserve instances for specific timesframes
				- e.g. once a week for a few hours
	- Available 1 or 3 year contract
	- Can resell unused instances via marketplace
	- The longer the cheaper
	- Payment options
		- All Upfront (cheapest)
		- Partial upfront
		- No upfront
- Spot Instances
	- Using AWS idle servers
	- Discounted 90%
	- Is terminated if needed by reserved instance customer
		- If terminated by AWS -> Not charged $$$ for partial hour
		- If terminated by me -> Charged per hour $$$

	- Answers: How can we know this EC2 instance is secure?
	- Can we prove it?
	- Runs a script that analyses EC2 instance
	- Then creates a PDF report
	- Shows which security checks passed
